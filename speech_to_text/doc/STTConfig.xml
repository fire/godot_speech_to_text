				Initializes [i]Pocketsphinx[/i] speech to text variables. The attributes for HMM directory name, dictionary filename and keywords filename must have been previously defined with the appropriate setters.
				Returns One of the following [STTError] values:
				- [member STTError.OK]
				- [member STTError.UNDEF_FILES_ERR]
				- [member STTError.USER_DIR_MAKE_ERR]
				- [member STTError.USER_DIR_COPY_ERR]
				- [member STTError.MULTIBYTE_STR_ERR]
				- [member STTError.MEMALLOC_ERR]
				- [member STTError.CONFIG_CREATE_ERR]
				- [member STTError.REC_CREATE_ERR]
				- [member STTError.DECODER_CREATE_ERR]
				[i]Note:[/i]
				- See [method set_hmm_dirname] for setting the HMM directory name
				- See [method set_dict_filename] for setting the dictionary filename
				- See [method set_kws_filename] for setting the keywords filename

		<member name="dictionary file" type="String" setter="set_dict_filename" getter="get_dict_filename">
			A text file containing words in the desired language, along with the phonemes for their pronunciation. These phonemes are defined in the [member hmm directory].
			Exemplifying, for US English, the word [b]red[/b] would have the following line in the dictionary file:
			[code]red R EH D[/code]

		<member name="hmm directory" type="String" setter="set_hmm_dirname" getter="get_hmm_dirname">
			The HMM (Hidden Markov Model) directory name. Known simply as the model, it contains a collection of files which statistically describe the language to be used.
			[i]CMUSphinx[/i], which created, [i]Pocketsphinx[/i] library, has a few language models available for free use on the following link:

		<member name="keywords file" type="String" setter="set_kws_filename" getter="get_kws_filename">
			Refers to a text file where every line contains a word and its respective detection threshold, isolated between [code]/[/code] characters. Each word must exist in the [member dictionary file].
			An example of a line in this file for the word [b]red[/b] would be:
			[code]red/1e-4/[/code]
